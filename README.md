This repo contains vanilla versions of the Linux kernel, busybox and uboot
alongside the linaro ARM cross toolchain (tarball) that I used to
cross-compile each of these. These have been pre-compiled earlier using this 
cross-toolchain for the ARM architecture (and vexpress board to be specific)

As I move forward in my belated journey of exploring them, I document it all
here for my own personal quick reference and perchance someone stumbling
across

Thanks
